**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my experiences as a Biomedical Engineer and Junior Data ANalyst, I recognize the critical need to integrate ethics and equity into my work, particularly within the healthcare sector. In my previous role at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, I collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to develop data models that predicted patient readmissions. Whil reduction in readmission ratesâ€”was a significant achievement, it is essential to evaluate how these models impacted different patient demographics. For example, I would consider whether the models adequately accounted for socioeconomic factors that could influence readmission rates, such as access to healthcare services, housing stability, or educational background. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate fairness metrics into predictive analytics, ensuring that models do not inadvertently perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.

Beyond my direct experiences, I have come to understand the importance of addressing systemic inequities within healthcare and research. It is critical to acknowledge that access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and representation in clinical studies often vary dramatically among different populations. Moving forward, I would advocate for inclusive data collection practices that actively seek to incorporate diverse populations, particularly those who have historically been underrepresented. This can help ensure that our findings and solutions are applicable to all segments of the population, reducing the risk of exacerbating existing health disparities.

Moreover, fostering collaboration across disciplines is essential to tackling inequity. By engaging with social scientists, community organizations, and policy makers, we can gain valuable insights into the socio-economic factors that contribute to health disparities. This interdisciplinary approach can inform more comprehensive solutions that not only address the immediate medical needs of patients but also consider broader social determinants of health.

In conclusion, integrating ethics and equity into my work is not merely a professional obligation but a personal commitment. I am dedicated to leveraging my skills in data science to create fair and effective solutions that improve healthcare outcomes for all individuals, especially those who have been marginalized. This approach requires continuous reflection, collaboration, and a willingness to challenge the status quo, ultimately striving to create a more just and equitable healthcare system.
